# üçïü•©üç£ FoodNet

FoodNet is a modern web application that uses deep learning to recognize food items from images and provide nutritional information. Upload a food photo, and FoodNet will predict the dish and show you its calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, and sugar content. The app is designed for foodies, fitness enthusiasts, and anyone curious about what's on their plate!
